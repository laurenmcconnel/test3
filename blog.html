											<h3>Role of Business Analytics</h3>
											<h5> 11/09/2023</h5>
											<p class="content">Business analytics can be defined as leveraging value from data. Data can detect new opportunities and niches in the marketplace, which can develop new products and services and aid the business in decision-making. (Acito et al., 2014). It involves using statistical and quantitative data and predictive and explanatory models. This data is turned into insights to aid the business in decision-making (INFORMS, 2016). There are many possibilities for the application of analytics in business, technology, and popular media. For example, It is often used to identify trends in employee turnover to allow the firm to intervene. Also to segment customers in order to effectively market towards loyal buyers.</span> </p>

    <h3>Data Analytics in the music industry</h3>
    <h5> 14/10/2023</h5>
    <p class="content"> Today I decided to research into the application of data analytics in the music industry. I learned that music services such as Spotify can recommend songs based on user preferences, and Shazam can identify songs by comparing sound snippets to digital databases. (Acito, F et al., 2014). <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Firms like Indify use data analytics to identify artists with high engagement on social media. This firm predicted the rise in popularity of the singer Khalid by analyzing his cross-platform growth. This involves growth across social media sites like YouTube, Instagram and Spotify (Complex News, 2019). Data analytics are also often used by labels to decide what platform an artist’s music is most popular on.</span> </p>

    <h3>What is Augmented Analytics? A Beginner’s Guide</h3>
    <h5>21/03/2024</h5>
    
    <p class="content"> I read an article from Austin Chia who explained augment analytics. Augmented analytics is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in the process of data analysis. It goes beyond traditional business intelligence (BI) by automating data preparation, insight generation, and even decision-making. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">This means that augmented analytics tools can help users explore and analyze large amounts of data in a faster, more efficient, and accurate way. With this new technique, users can uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that may not be easily visible through manual analysis. Augmented analytics uses AI and ML algorithms to process and analyze large datasets. These algorithms are designed to learn from the data, identify patterns, and make predictions or recommendations. This is tools like Tableau, and Power BI. </span> </p>

    <h3>Machine Learning in Production — How to Operate a Model factory</h3>
    <h5> 20/11/2021</h5>
    
    <p class="content"> Today I read an article by Julien Kervizic about Machine Learning in Production. He wrote about Understanding the Machine Learning lifecycle. There are multiple phases within a machine learning model lifecycle, from data collection to data cleansing, experimentation, debugging, or deprecation. Building a model factory means simplifying and automating each of these steps as much as possible to gain the fastest pace of iteration.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">When looking at leveraging data to power an ML model factory, there are different things to consider. What initial data will be fed for the model training? How will the various labels be populated? What will be the metrics needed to monitor the model’s performance? Approaches such as DMAIC from SixSigma methodology provide a Data collection plan as their empirical approach to process improvement and problem-solving. Most Machine Learning initiatives attempt to optimize processes and (should) embody similar improvement process methodologies.

    <h3>Expert Interview: Beyond the Buzzword – Understanding the Ethical Implications of AI</h3>
    <h5> 27/11/2023</h5>
 
    <p class="content"> Today I read an article by Matthew Deery about the ethical implications of using AI. This was a blog post about an interview with Willliam Tracy  a North Carolina native with a masters and BS in mechanical engineering, and a BA in toy design, an expert in linkage design and optimization.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">When asked 'What are the ethical implications of using synthetic data in training models?' He said it’s best to always consider where the data comes from in the first place. One solution to get around using ethically-fraught real-world data is to use a set of synthetic data instead. Synthetic data is said to remove ethical issues, as the data is generated and not real. However, it’s still important to consider how the data was created and if there was inherent bias added while it was created. While running the data, it’s possible for there to be increased model error in the final product, because synthetic data doesn’t capture all real-world aspects and uses. Finally, if the synthetic data doesn’t capture real-world issues, this may allow for unforeseen ethical issues when the model is finally exposed to real data.</span> </p>

      <h3>Is Your Business Primed For Growth? How Data Can Address Internal Barriers</h3>
    <h5> 6/07/2018</h5>

    
    <p class="content"> Today I found an article by Larry Alton about How Data Can Address Internal Barriers. Here is a snippet: In the past, many companies hired consultants to gain an outsider perspective on day-to-day practices, but today you can maximize professional insights by turning to business intelligence (BI) tools.The two most important tools are 'Ramping up retention rates' and 'Assessing group dynamics'. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Retention rates: Whenever an employee leaves your company, no matter the circumstances, they need to take an exit survey. As you bank exit interview data, you begin to get a sense of what you could have done differently to keep valuable staff on board and save your company money. Group Dynamics: Your employees are your greatest asset, and you shouldn’t let your business stagnate because you’re not fostering their talents and relationships. Instead, add some structure to the human element of your operations and take a data-driven approach to HR. It can put your business on the road to an exciting future.</span> </p>

    <h3>Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning: What Enterprises Need to Know</h3>
    <h5> No Date</h5>

    <p class="content"> I decided to research into the difference between deep learning and machine learning.The terms deep learning and machine learning are sometimes used interchangeably, but that's a mistake. They're closely connected, but not synonymous: Deep learning shares machine learning's core capability of improving its performance without human intervention, but it's much more structurally complex.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Machine learning is an offshoot of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to examine large data sets and learn from them, without any human intervention aside from the initial programming and training process. Deep learning is an advanced subset of ML. It's distinguished by its interconnected and at least triple-layered series of nodes known as an artificial neural network (ANN). The various layers in a deep learning model allow it to process massive amounts of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data and analyze it with a degree of complexity modeled after the human brain.</span> </p>

    <h3>Fight financial crime with fraud analytics</h3>
    <h5> No Date</h5>

    <p class="content"> This post is from the teradata website about fraud detection. Here is a snippet. In the technology-driven business world, data security and integrity have never been more important. This is particularly true in sectors commonly targeted for fraud, including banking, financial services, and healthcare. The term fraud analytics refers to all the core data analytics and data science methods, tools, and best practices that are used to stop and mitigate financial fraud.  <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">The most advanced analytics tools used to detect major types of fraudulent activity automate most of their processes. This is only achievable at scale through artificial intelligence (AI)—often specifically through machine learning (ML) tools. All major ML training methods can be leveraged to prepare optimal analytics solutions for fraud detection. Supervised learning, for example, is beneficial for engineering traditional banking, insurance, and healthcare fraud analytics systems, all of which rely heavily on large volumes of historical data. By contrast, newer financial methods, such as open banking, won't have amassed as much data from the past, so unsupervised learning makes more sense for fraud detection in those contexts.</span> </p>
